Saved_Results_analysis
======================

This folder contains scripts and data files for post-simulation analysis and visualization 
of secrecy rate maximization results in backscatter communication systems.

---

## Folder Overview

- **main_post_analysis.m**  
  Main script for post-processing, statistical analysis, and plotting of simulation results. 
  Use this to generate figures and tables for reports or publications.

- **load_and_analyze_data.m**  
  Loads simulation results from .mat files and performs further analysis, such as calculating 
  averages, variances, and generating summary statistics.

- **save_simulation_data.m**  
  Utility script for saving simulation results from the main simulation workspace into .mat files 
  for later analysis.

- **tol_e-4_sim_results.mat** / **tol_e-6_simu_results.mat**  
  These MATLAB data files are generated by running the simulation scripts in the `Main` folder and 
  contain the raw results for different parameter settings or tolerances.

- **post_analysis_results.mat**  
  This MATLAB data file is produced by running `main_post_analysis.m` in this folder and contains 
  processed or summarized analysis results.

## Usage Instructions

1. Place the .mat simulation result files in this folder (if not already present).
2. Run `load_and_analyze_data.m` to load and inspect the results.
3. Use `main_post_analysis.m` to generate plots and perform further analysis.
4. If you need to save new results, use `save_simulation_data.m` from your simulation workspace.

## Notes

- All scripts are designed for MATLAB.
